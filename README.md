### ðŸ“Œ Iris  
Iris is an open and free instant chat made with python3 based on client / server / client communication made by me during my free time.  
  
### ðŸ’­ How to use it ?  
ðŸ’¾ Server Side :  
-> Just put server-related files located in <a href="https://github.com/Neptune-IT/Iris/tree/main/server">server folder</a> in your own machine.  
-> Put your own machine's settings in the <a href="https://github.com/Neptune-IT/Iris/tree/main/server/server_settings.json">server_settings.json</a> file.  
-> Then just start server with :
```python
python3 server.py
```
<br>
ðŸ’»Client Side :  
-> Then download client-related files located in <a href="https://github.com/Neptune-IT/Iris/tree/main/client">client folder</a> in your PC.  
-> After, just start <a href="https://github.com/Neptune-IT/Iris/tree/main/client/client.py">client.py</a> file and put your machine's ip-adress and socket port.  
- exemple :  
```python
python3 client.py

#~ Put the server ip-adress : 127.0.0.1
#~ Put the connection port : 12345
[+] You are currently chatting on server 127.0.0.1 with port 12345
```
